 - Input image formats supported: `.png`, `.bmp`, `.qoi`
 - **Extract icon images** as `.png` files
 - Multiple GUI styles with support for custom ones (`.rgs`)
 - Command-line support for icons packing and extraction
 - Command-line supports configurable image scaling algorithms
 - **Completely portable (single-file, no-dependencies)**

## Basic Usage

Drag & drop your `.ico`/`.icns`/`.png` files to unpack/add the different available image sizes, missing sizes could also be generated (using biggest available size).

**Custom image text data** can be added per icon image and it will be embedded in the `.ico`/`.icns`/`.png` file, useful for copyright data or nice _icon-poems_.
